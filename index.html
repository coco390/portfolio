    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Transitioning from a career in math education, I am equipped with a comprehensive background that combines instructional design,
      technology, and front-end development. Holding a Master of Education in Instructional Design, I have honed my skills in creating effective,
      learner-centered educational experiences. My bachelor's degree in technology provides a solid foundation in technical principles,
      while completing Meta's front-end developer course on Coursera has further enhanced my proficiency in modern web development technologies.
      This unique blend of instructional expertise and technical acumen positions me to contribute effectively to educational technology initiatives,
      curriculum development, and e-learning projects, ensuring they are both pedagogically sound and technologically advanced.
